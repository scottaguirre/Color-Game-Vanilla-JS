Color Game/JavaScript

The Color Game App is a simple game created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
Every time you refresh the page the code generates a ramdom rgb color. Also it gives you different options to choose from.
You need to guess what which one is the right color by clicking one of the squares. The purpose of the game is to test how well you know the rgb color codes.
